# Introduction
An operating system acts as an intermediary between the user of a computer and computer hardware. The purpose of an operating system is to provide an environment in which a user can execute programs conveniently and efficiently. 

An operating system is a software that manages computer hardware. The hardware must provide appropriate mechanisms to ensure the correct operation of the hacking system and to prevent user programs from interfering with the proper operation of the hacking. 

An operating system is a program that controls the execution of programs and acts as an interface between the user of a computer and the computer hardware.
A more common definition is that the operating system is the one program running at all times on the computer (usually called the kernel), with all else being language programs.
An operating system is concerned with the allocation of resources and services, such as status of hacking, processes, devices, and information. The operating system correspondingly includes programs to manage these resources, such as a traffic controller, I/O programs, and a file system.


#Functions of project â€“ performs three functions: 
Convenience: An OS makes a computer more convenient to use for hacking.
Efficiency: An OS allows the computer system resources to be used efficiently used network service, tracking.
Ability to Evolve: An OS should be constructed in such a way as to permit the effective hacking,  testing, and introduction of new system functions at the same time without interfering with service.
Throughput: An OS should be constructed so that It can give maximum throughput(Number of tasks per unit time).
